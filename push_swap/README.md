## About the project

> _This project is pretty straight forward. You will recode printf. Hopefully you will be able to reuse it in future project without the fear of being flagged as a cheater. You will mainly learn how to use variadic arguments. This project consists of coding a library that contains a simplified version of the printf function._

    This project consists of coding a program that finds the lowest possible number of moves to
